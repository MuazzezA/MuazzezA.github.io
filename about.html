            <p class="job-description">
                I worked on advanced applications and technologies, though I had limited involvement with native iOS and Android code.
                I also developed expertise in working with OpenVPN, IPsec, and IKEv2 protocols by leveraging network extension on the iOS platform.
                I had experience in publishing and updating npm package versions.
                Gained skills in debugging, communication, documentation preparation, and writing clean code.
                I had the opportunity to write clean, reusable, shareable code between projects. I worked on ad integration with AppLovin and AdMob.
                I used technologies like Fastlane, Jenkins, AppCenter.

            <p class="job-description">
                Implemented PDF parsing and filtering by adding native modules for iOS and Android, successfully processing a 50-page PDF in under 10 seconds.
                Optimization techniques improved code performance by reducing data sorting and processing time from 20 seconds to 7 seconds.
                I worked on animations and their performance enhancement, faster loading of images.
